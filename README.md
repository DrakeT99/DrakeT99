- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrakeT99
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and becoming a pro at R and SQL coding in  time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work on a portfolio and with others on a team, since I finished my Google certification. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects with teams that can offer guidance, insight, and a chance to learn and improve my budding skills.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is on Discord (dr8_i_miss_you) or by email at draketimothy99@gmail.com
